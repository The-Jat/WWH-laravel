## Migrations

Laravel Migration is an essential feature in Laravel that allows you to create a table in your database.
It allows you to modify and share the application's database schema.
You can modify the table by adding a new column or deleting an existing column.

### Why do we need Laravel Migration?

Suppose we are working in a team, and some idea strikes that require the alteration in a table.
In such a case, the SQL file needs to be passed around, and some team member has to import that file, but team member forgot to import the SQL file.
In this case, the application will not work properly, to avoid such situation, Laravel Migration comes into existence.

Laravel Migration allows you to add a new column or delete the records in your database without deleting the records that are already present.
