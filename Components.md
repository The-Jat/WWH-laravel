## What is Laravel Component?

A component is a piece of code, which we can reuse in any blade template. Itâ€™s something similar to sections, layouts, and includes. For example, we use the same header for each template, so we can create a Header component, which we can reuse.

Another use of components for better understanding is like you need to use a Sign-Up button on the website at many places, like in the header, footer, or any other place on the website. Then make a component of that button code and reuse it.
