## What is Laravel Component?

A component is a piece of code, which we can reuse in any blade template. Itâ€™s something similar to sections, layouts, and includes. For example, we use the same header for each template, so we can create a Header component, which we can reuse.

Another use of components for better understanding is like you need to use a Sign-Up button on the website at many places, like in the header, footer, or any other place on the website. Then make a component of that button code and reuse it.

## How to Make Component in Laravel.

For example, we create a Header component. Below artisan command is used to create the header component.
```
php artisan make:component component_name
```

This command makes two files in your laravel project.

One PHP file is created with the name of component_name.php inside app/http/View/Components directory.

And another HTML file is created with the name of component.blade.php inside resources/views/components/ directory.

You can also make components with in subdirectories like:
```
php artisan make:component Forms/Button
```
This command will create a button component in App\View\Components\Forms directory and the blade file will be placed in the resources/views/components/forms directory.

This syntax is used to rendered component in HTML file:
```
<x-ComponentName/>
```
